   - perl script to dump out cuda code as per the sample_input_file
 sample_input_file
   - contins the description of a sample_input_file
 a.out
   - executable to be run directly
 workListKernel.cu
   - main program
 log

   This program requires support of gaol interval arithmetic library.
   Once gaol and its supporting APMath library has been installed and nvcc and its libraries are available in path

   Run the following command to generate the executable:
     >>  nvcc -Xcompiler -fopenmp --std=c++11 workListKernel.cu -lgaol -lm -lultim -lgdtoa -lgomp

    once a.out is generated, execute a.out
	>> ./a.out
